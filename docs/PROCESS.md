# Process Reflection

For this week's assignment, I built a filter feature for the training programs on my Leash and Lead site. Users can now filter programs by difficulty: Puppy, Basic, or Advanced. I added a level property to each program object, wired filter buttons to update state, and made sure the UI updates dynamically when a user clicks a difficulty. I also included edge cases, like showing a "No programs found for this level" message when there are no programs to display. I fixed a React key issue and made sure the filter buttons look good on mobile.

I really liked working in small steps using micro-iteration. Breaking the feature into 8 small steps made it easier to focus, test, and understand what each piece of code was doing. Even though it took longer than writing everything at once, it was worth it because it prevented mistakes and made debugging way simpler. For example, I added a badge to each card early on to show the level. At first, it seemed useful, but once I added the filter buttons, I realized the badge was actually kind of redundant. That taught me to think about how each step fits into the bigger picture instead of just doing what the instructions say.

I used Claude Code on the web for all my steps, but I didn't really like it. It felt slower and harder to work with compared to the terminal version I had used before. It was sometimes frustrating to type prompts, wait for a response, and then copy things into my editor. That said, asking Claude to self-review the code was helpful. For example, it suggested extracting the filtered list into a variable and changing the React key from index to program.title so the cards render more reliably. Those small suggestions made the code cleaner and more reliable, and I could see the benefit of reviewing the AI's work.

Overall, this exercise showed why micro-iteration and self-review are useful. I feel more confident building features step by step and testing as I go. It also reminded me that tools matter. Even with the slowdown, doing the steps carefully helped me understand React.
